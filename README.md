# Aircraft Scheduler

### How To Run:

Project was started with a significantly pared back version of `create-react-app` to ease Webpack config time.

Run `npm install` to get dependencies.

Either run `npm run build` and open up the `index.html` file, or just run `npm start` to fire up a local version on port `http://localhost:8080`.
